ðŸ”‘ Be aware of your kids internet navigation

## Inspiration
Every day, we have more access to more information, and it's awesome! But at the same time, kid get access to internet earlier, and along with that, kids can access to some inappropriate content.

## What it does
With our chrome extension, you can be notified every time someone gets into a page with inappropriate content.

Tu use it, you only need to fill the chrome extension form with your mobile number and activate it. After it, every time someone gets in a page with inappropriate content on chrome, you will receive an SMS on your mobile.

## How we built it

Frontend and backend are very different components connected by API requests.

At frontend, there's a Chrome extension made with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

In the backend, we have a [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-372/) application which runs with [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and uses [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) and [Connexion](https://connexion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library) to generate a bunch of endpoints and connect the frontend with the backend.
In addition, we are using [Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/) service from [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/).

In order to communicate with the users, we've used [Nexmo](https://www.nexmo.com)'s API, which allow us to work with SMS technology 

All this system is finally deployed in a [Google Cloud VM](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/).
